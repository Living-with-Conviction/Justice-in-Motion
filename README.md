# Justice-in-Motion

<p>
  Justice in Motion is the cornerstone of our Legal Empowerment Program. It will help formerly incarcerated individuals prepare court forms to request reductions of court-imposed debt. For decades, this debt has been accruing interest at at least 12%. Once it goes to a private collection agency, interest increases to 19% to 50%.

<p>  
If people get behind in their payments they can be arrested.
</p>

<p>
  This debt criminalizes poverty, keeping people “shackled” to the criminal justice system for life.
</p>

<p>  
This project is to help us help them.
